const ourTwoWorldsData = '<p class="is-size-4 is-size-9-touch"><span class="has-text-weight-bold">U</span>p upon the risers, the choir stands their ground, while crowds of nameless faces, anticipate their sound. Voices dance with music, flowing to my ears. Fades into the distance, all but disappears. My world ignites with longing, when you I chance to see. Your world of sweet contentment, separate from me.</p> <div class="divider is-size-4 is-size-7-touch"></div><p class="is-size-4 is-size-9-touch"><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Y</span>our hair of darkest night, with glistening moonlight, stirs a furied hurricane, my heart cannot contain. Our worlds are two, what can I do, to bridge this canyon grand. Our hearts to bind, our love to find, together, hand in hand.</p> <div class="divider is-size-4 is-size-7-touch"></div><p class="is-size-4 is-size-9-touch"><span class="has-text-weight-bold">T</span>he echoes of applause, slap me across the face. The rising tide of people, of you I lose all trace. Like I saw a shooting star, I walk away in awe. Wishing someday soon, you\'ll see the love I saw.</p> <div class="divider is-size-4 is-size-7-touch"></div><p class="is-size-4 is-size-9-touch"><span class="has-text-weight-bold">I</span> choose my way across the floor, to the exit sign. As I open up the door, I find your hand on mine. We\'ve both tried to exit, it seems at the same place. My heart explodes inside me, from this innocent embrace. You turn to me and I look back, our eyes connecting true. Instantly a world is formed, from what had once been two.</p> <div class="divider is-size-4 is-size-7-touch"></div><p class="is-size-4 is-size-9-touch"><span class="has-text-weight-bold">"O</span>h, excuse me," you do say. I cling to every word. Certain with no doubt inside, "I love you," I\'ve just heard. I step aside and you walk through, into the parking lot. Filling up with human hordes, you\'re soon a tiny dot. What we\'ve had is swallowed whole, by this chaotic beast. With dripping tongue on our one world, it absently does feast.</p> <div class="divider is-size-4 is-size-7-touch"></div><p class="is-size-4 is-size-9-touch"><span class="has-text-weight-bold">S</span>lowly life continues. I watch weeks drain away. I wish I would have spoken, more to you that day. Two worlds again we have, and I\'m thinking of you. Longing for that moment, when our worlds are not two.</p> <div class="divider is-size-4 is-size-7-touch"></div><p class="is-size-4 is-size-9-touch"><span class="has-text-weight-bold">S</span>omeday all will see, those two worlds will be so. And when that day comes, my love for you you\'ll know. For now I lay here dreaming, of when all that may be. Perhaps that time is now, you\'ve sent something to me.</p> <div class="divider is-size-4 is-size-7-touch"></div><p class="is-size-4 is-size-9-touch"><span class="has-text-weight-bold">E</span>agerly I open it, my pulse is racing fast. Finally the moment, I\'ve been waiting for at last. Like a viper striking fast, I quickly feel the sting. My world crumbles around, the invite to your wedding.</p> <div class="divider is-size-4 is-size-7-touch"></div></div>';
